# Instructions
## Part 1: Creating a database

Save all of your instructions in a script file - you will submit this file on Gnomio and github.

- Create a database called “Umuzi”.

- Create the following tables in the Umuzi database:

    - Customers
    - Employees
    - Orders
    - Payments
    - Products
    
- Create a primary key for each table with auto-increment (make sure you correctly specify the data types, e.g. the ID field should be int).

- Create foreign keys so that every ID in the order table references an existing ID in the tables referenced (e.g., ProductID, EmployeeID, etc).

- INSERT the records in the tables below into the table you created in step 2.

- Document what information is stored in your database. Be sure to say what information is kept in what table, and which keys link the records between tables.
